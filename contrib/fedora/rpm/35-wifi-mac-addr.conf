# This sets defaults to Wi-Fi profiles to set a stable MAC address.
#
# Do not modify this file. You can hide/overwrite this file by placing a
# file to "/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/35-wifi-mac-addr.conf". You can also
# set the settings per-profile, so that these defaults are not used.
#
# For example, on some networks you could set
#
#   $ nmcli connection modify "$PROFILE" connection.stable-id '${CONNECTION}/${BOOT}'
#
# or
#
#   $ nmcli connection modify "$PROFILE" wifi.cloned-mac-address permanent
#
# See `man 5 nm-settings` for "wifi.cloned-mac-address" and "connection.stable-id".
